# Face Recognition Application

## Description

This project is a face recognition application that utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize faces in real-time from a camera feed.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashguptatech/face-recognition.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training Images

1. Create a directory named Training_images:

   ```bash
   mkdir Training_images
   ```

   This directory will store the images you want to use for training your face recognition model.

   Place the images you want to use for training in this directory.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 facerecognition.py
   ```

   This command will start the face recognition application and utilize the camera feed for real-time face recognition.
2. The application will detect and recognize faces in the camera feed.
3. If a recognized face is detected, the application will display the name or identification associated with that face.
4. To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
